# Libratica
A demo for a fully fledged Library site created using Asp.net with Entity Framework and MySQL. Frontend was created using basic Razor syntax and Bootstrap.

# Uses
As i have commented all my code the project should prove usefull as an example of entity framework and how to use Visual Studio MVC to create a fully fledged site
with login/profile functionality, the ability to save new data to a database(add books) and display of said data through a book list. The login and profile functionality was 
created more or less from the bottom up, which is great if you want to learn how to create basic user profiles, but not so great if you want a deeper dive into Identity.
